    <strong>Azeta</strong> is a tree-to-bar chocolate brand born in the serene town of <strong>Pollachi, Tamil Nadu</strong>.  
    Founded by <strong>Vibhu Nishanth</strong> — a chemical engineer turned chocolate craftsman — Azeta is the harmony of science and heritage.  
    Inspired by his family's cacao plantation and guided by his engineering precision, Vibhu set out to create chocolate that celebrates purity, sustainability, and innovation.

      <h2>The Home of Our Cacao Trees</h2>
      <p>
        Nestled near the lush <strong>Parambikulam Tiger Reserve</strong>, our cacao plantation thrives in harmony with nature.  
        Alongside our <em>Theobroma Cacao</em> trees, we cultivate coconut, areca nut, and pepper — all part of a sustainable ecosystem that respects the rhythm of the forest.  
        We follow pesticide-free farming, and our drip irrigation system ensures water conservation while protecting wildlife around us.  
        Every pod is hand-harvested, dried under the Pollachi sun, and prepared for its next journey — from bean to bar.

      <h2>The Art of Fermentation</h2>
      <p>
        At Azeta, we embrace the <strong>traditional wooden-box fermentation method</strong> — a delicate, seven-day process that shapes the soul of our chocolate.  
        Natural yeasts from the cacao pods begin the transformation, producing gentle acetic acids that build depth and complexity.  
        The temperature rises, cell walls break, and aromatic compounds emerge — creating the signature richness of our beans.  
        Each batch is monitored, tested, and perfected to bring you cocoa that speaks of Pollachi’s soil, sun, and spirit.
